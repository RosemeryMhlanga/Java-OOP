# Java-OPP Development
# Problem that my code solve
The problem is that the estate agency had two separate  department for Properties they are renting out, which are Residential properties and Business Properties. This caused alot of clashes, causing lack of transparency and lack of communication. This in turn led to poor business decision making
# Description of my problem-solving approach
I used Object oriented programming, I created a superclass called Property where i grouped similar attribute from both departments. then creating two abstract classes for the two department with unique attributes for each class, then i used inheritance o that that they can belong to the same super class.
